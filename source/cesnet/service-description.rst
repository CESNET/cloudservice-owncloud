CESNET Service description
==========================

<chapter stub>
CESNET's ownCloud is a relatively new service. It has been added to the CESNET Storage department's service portfolio on 11th of Aplil 2014. The service operated by Czech NREN is meant to be an alternative to some well-known global cloud storage services. It's purpose is to support research & academic user groups with storage and collaboration capabilities.

Access to the service is allowed for institutions involved in eduGAIN_ (operated by GÃ‰ANT) and eduID_ (operated by CESNET) academic federations. It's also possible to gain acces to the ownCloud if
user doesn't belong to the above mentioned federations. For these situations, Hostel_ accounts can
be used, but users must have a validated Hostel_ accounts (proven that they belong to an academic or research organizations).

As of January 2015, there are 2600 users using the service with approx. 24 TB of stored data. 
Accounts for newcomers are created automatically upon first login and
each new account is given a 100 GB quota.

TODO:
