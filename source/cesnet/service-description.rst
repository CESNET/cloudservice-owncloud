CESNET Service description
==========================

CESNET's ownCloud is a relatively new service. It has been added to the CESNET Storage department's service portfolio on 11th of April 2014. The service operated by Czech NREN is meant to be an alternative to some well-known global cloud storage services. Its purpose is to support research & academic user groups with storage and collaboration needs.

Access to the service is allowed for institutions involved in eduGAIN_ (operated by GÃ‰ANT) and eduID_ (operated by CESNET) academic federations. It's also possible to gain acces to the ownCloud if
user doesn't have access to the above mentioned federations, provided the user is affiliated to an institution compliant with the `CESNET Access Policy_`. For these situations, a validated Hostel_ account can
be used to access the federated web interface (validated accounts require the users to prove their affiliation to an academic and/or rsearch organizations by means of supplying a signed statement).

As of January 2015, there are 2600 users using the service with approx. 24 TB of stored data. 
Accounts for newcomers are created automatically upon first login and
each new account is given a 100 GB quota. We are providing the service with a
best-effort policy (i.e., we do our best to keep the service up and running, there is no formal SLA) and with no pay-per-use model. The users are required to comply
with data storage general `Terms of service`_.

Our ownCloud service can be used as:

* collaboration platform (file sharing and collaborative document editing),
* local cloud storage platform (synchronization between clients, all data stored in the territory of the Czech Republic),
* backup platform (all stored data is backed up to tapes; more suitable backup solutions are neverheless provided by CESNET Data Storage for backups of larger data sets).
